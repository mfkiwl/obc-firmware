// TODO - find out which of these is internal, which is external, merge them.

// this is development code to aid in implementing watchdog kicking on interrupt

// not necessarily in Uos3 Cubesat flight software - risk that automatically kicking on interrupt

// might prevent watchdog timer resetting when operation has actually failed

// Two ways to initialise the interrupt. Dynamically with TimerIntRegister, or statically by setting
// the define variable TIMER0A to the routine name (with my modified tm4c_startup_gcc.c this works)

// Developed for Uos3 Cubesat
