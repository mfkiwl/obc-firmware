 * @brief I2C driver for the firmware.
 * 
 * Task ref: [UT_2.8.7]
 * 
 * I2C, like all other IO drivers, uses an internal state rather than the
 * DataPool for storing data. Users of the I2C driver are responsible for
 * handling I2C errors (either themselves or by propagating to FDIR system).
 * This is because many hardware endpoints can be connected to the I2C bus, so
 * errors in those endpoints must be handled by the component responsible for
 * them. The I2C driver itself won't understand the meaning of IMU error codes,
 * for example.
 * 
 * There are a number of I2C actions available:
 *  - Send byte to device (I2C_ACTION_SINGLE_SEND)
 *  - Receive byte from device register (I2C_ACTION_SINGLE_RECV)
 *  - Send bytes to device (I2C_ACTION_BURST_SEND)
 *  - Receive bytes from device register (I2C_ACTION_BURST_RECV)
 * 
 * All actions are state machines themselves, meaning that they may be exited
 * while waiting on events to occur such as an interrupt. This
