    - check global I2C has been initialised
    - check there's enough space for the action
    - build a I2c_ActionSingleSend structure
    - place it into the I2C global
    - set the action type for the same index
    - return true
- I2c_device_recv_bytes
- I2c_get_device_action_status
    - check global I2C has been initialised
    - iterate through I2C.actions that are not NONE and get status if the
      devices match
